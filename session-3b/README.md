# JavaScript Session 4 starter files

Starter files:

- `index.html`
- `index.js`

The `index.js` is already connected to the `index.html` on `line 14`. All you need to do is write your JavaScript code in the `index.js` file and open the `index.html` in a browser.

Every time you make a change in the `index.js` (and it's been saved) all you will need to do is refresh the `index.html` in the browser and you will see your changes come through.
